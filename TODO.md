- Rings of fire (adds overheat)
- Boost (Bar + Pickups + maybe fix impulse/force?)
- Hot wheels-like loops
- Overheat (after too much boost? + make self modulate of car sprite more read)
- Hooks (to grapple with)

- player starts with some amount of cargo
- player should not pitch forward while boosting
- instead of reloading when finishing the level should we show a win screen?
